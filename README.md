# School_District_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to remove the Thomas High School math and reading scores for the ninth graders and obtain the following:
* The district summary
* The school summary
* The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* The average math score for each grade level from each school
* The average reading score for each grade level from each school
* The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

### Background
The Thomas High School ninth graders math and reading scores were found to be altered. Due to academic dishonesty these grades need to be dropped from the original analysis so the school averages aren't skewed.
